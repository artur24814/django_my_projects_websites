<h3>Website for looking translation of words and create your self vocabulary and train your knowledge in a card game</h3>

<p>On the main page you can see the word of the day which will automatically change at 00:01 <span style='font-size:20px;'>&#128197;</span>. 
You can translate the words and dynamically receiving the result you can add to the dictionary this translation if you need.</p>
<p>When user write his word and push the button 'translate' he will get definition shown under the button (this view use Ajax and jQuery and all definition we will get dynamically),

</p>
<p>To save this word and definition to it, user should push on a card with particularly word (user must be log in to be able to do it)and it save to dictionary and will be shown at a global dictionary and his own dictionary, 
when word save to dictionary you will get information about it.‚¨á

<center>Home page</center>


<p>On the page we have two dictionaries - one general and the other personal for each user. In a personal dictionary there will be words that user
added personally, on the home page when you click on descriptions which you need this word and description will be on your own dictionary (you can add words only when you are logged in). You can change or delete your own words. </p>

<p>Also we have two options card game, you can play with all the words, or you can  play with the words from your own dictionary (but when you have in the 
dictionary more than 16 words). The game is: you got 16 card with random word on one side of the card you have a word, and on the back of card you have definition, when you click on the particular card it turns around and you can see the translation of this word,
when you click again card turn back. This view using javascript and animate css.

<p>And that's not all, you can practice in inventing  sentences to words (it should be at least 25 letters)  and if you are satisfied with your creativity, you can share it with other users.
When you are in page 'frasses/' you get one random word to practice, when you push the button 'try other word' you will get another one word (using Ajax and jQuery).
When you use the button 'share you through to another users' this word and your thought will be shown in the 'BLOG'

<h3 id="clone_project">Clone and Run a Django Project</h3>

Before diving let‚Äôs look at the things we are required to install in our system.

To run Django prefer to use the Virtual Environment

`pip install virtualenv`

Making and Activating the Virtual Environment:-

`virtualenv ‚Äúname as you like‚Äù`

`source env/bin/activate`

Installing Django:-

`pip install django`

Now, we need to clone project from Github:-
<p>Above the list of files, click Code.</p>
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-20363/images/help/repository/code-button.png">

Copy the URL for the repository.
<ul>
<li>To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", click</li>
<li>To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click</li>
<li>To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33207/images/help/repository/https-url-clone-cli.png">

Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

`$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`

Press Enter to create your local clone.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...<br>
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Install the project dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now go to the setting.py and change the SECRET_KEY.
from
`SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`
to
`SECRET_KEY = 'your own secret key'`

create admin account (**remember you must be at the main application folder with file manage.py, and do this steps for
each application in this repository!!!!**)

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

then

`python manage.py makemigrations`

then again run

`python manage.py migrate`

run this command to start periodic tasks in application(in Kinomania it is checking data in tickets and deleting not
active, in Dictionary it is changing the word of day)

`python manage.py crontab add`

to start the development server

`python manage.py runserver`

and open localhost:8000 on your browser to view the app.

Have fun
