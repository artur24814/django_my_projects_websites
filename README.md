  <p>User to book tickets should register and then he can see all his tickets.
After the date on which the tickets were booked they will be deleted from the database. Also, if the room was not booked by the administrator and it is free on that date, the user can book the whole room by himself. </p>

<li><srtong><h1>DICTIONARY</h1></srtong></li>
<p>Website for looking translation of words and create your self vocabulary and train your knowledge in a card game</p>

</p>


<p>On the page we have two dictionaries - one general and the other personal for each user. In a personal dictionary there will be words that user
added personally (you can add words only when you are logged in). You can change or delete your own words. </p>

  </p>

<p>Also we have two options card game, you can play with all the words, or you can  play with the words of a specific user (but when you have in the 
dictionary more than 16 words). The game is that on one side of the card you have a word, and on the back you have definitions, when you click on the card it turns and you can preview the translation

</p>
<p>And that's not all, you can practice in inventing  sentences to words (it should be at least 25 letters)  and if you are satisfied with your creativity, you can share it with other users
